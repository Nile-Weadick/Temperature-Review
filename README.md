# Temperature-Review
A program allows the user to select a file that contains the daily high temperature of a month on each line. Then calculates the min, max, and average. 

The file will contain the month name on the first line and each line that follows will contain the daily high temperature. The number of temperatures will vary from month to month and you need not confirm the number of temperatures is appropriate for the month. 

When the user clicks the “Select a File” button, the standard file open dialog will open and allow the user to select a data file. The selected filename and path should then appear next to the button. Any previously generated statistics will be cleared from the window.

When a user clicks the “Report Results” button the Month Statistics should be processed and displayed by reading the data from the file and process the temperature data. Generate the average based on the number of temperatures found in the file. The use of an array might be helpful but is not required.
